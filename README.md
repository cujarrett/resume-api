## What
Open source REST API for my [JSON-based standard format resume](https://jsonresume.org/).

## Why
To build something simple with Go. To expose my resume as an API as [JSON-based standard for resumes](https://jsonresume.org/).

### Why Go?
- It's compiled. So you get small binaries.
- It's fast. (slower than c/c++ or rust) but faster than most other web programming languages.
